# Module 2 Challenge - Analysis

## Overview of Project

####      The Purpose of the project is to help Steve analyze some stock data using VBA. Firstly, I help Steveâ€™s parents with the performance of one particular stock, Daqo. Secondly, help Steve analyze the Data for the entire stock market over the last few years. Lastly, refactor the code to work perfectly on larger amount of data and compare the performance of the refactored code to the original one.

## Result

### Performance of stocks in 2017

#### In the year 2017, All the stocks except TERP have had a positive return which therefore implies a good year for the stock market, as seen in the screen shot. [ALL_Stocks_2017] (https://github.com/arjunkannawar/Stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/All_Stock_2017.png)

### Performance of Stocks in 2018

#### In 2018, Only two stocks have had a positive return, ENPH and RUN. They have also been amongst the top three traded stocks in the year, as seen in the attached link. [ALL_stocks_2018] (https://github.com/arjunkannawar/Stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/All_Stock_2018.png)

### Performance of the Original code vs the Refactored code

#### The refactored code has performed better than the signal code. The result for the year 2017 is that the refactored code [VBA_Challenge_2017] (Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png) is 0.03 seconds faster than the original code [VBA_orignalscript_2017] (Resources/VBA_orignal Script_2017.png) while the refactored code for 2018 [VBA_Challenge_2018] (Resources/VBA_challenge_2018.png) has performed approximately 0.2 seconds faster than the original code [VBA_orignalscript_20178] (Resources/VBA_orignal_2018.png).

## Summary

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

#### The amin goal of code refactoring is to make it easy to enhance and maintain in the future. Refactoring code is a way to make the code efficient - interms of performance, improving the logic or optimizing the steps taken to complete the task at hand. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA Script?

#### The rafactoring of code has helped improve the performace of the code with an improved execution time.
